                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <blockquote>
                        As described in York et al. 2024, an automated pipeline was developed to extract a multi-ion catalog of narrow quasar (QSO) 
                        absorption lines from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 quasar spectra. The resulting catalog of absorption data supports 
                        a wealth of astrophysical applications, including studies of intergalactic and circum-galactic abundances, large scale clustering, 
                        and galaxy evolution. <br> <br>

                        All individual absorption lines detected outside of the Lyman alpha forest have been either grouped into absorption systems 
                        with a specific redshift or reported as unidentified. The most essential information about these absorption 
                        systems has been compiled in a system summary catalog, which can be downloaded as a single FITS table using the link above. 
                        This catalog includes both intervening (z_absorber < z_QSO) and associated (z_absorber ∼ z_QSO) absorption systems, 
                        constructed through the initial detection of multiple transitions of Mg II, C IV, and/or Fe II. <br> <br>

                        A full description of the motivation and the data products of the SDSS DR7 QSO absorption line catalog is provided in the 
                        associated manuscript (York et al. 2024), along with statistical analyses of key parameters often used to characterize QSOALS as 
                        a sample, e.g., completeness limits, the number of detections of various ions, and the number of absorbers per unit redshift. <br> <br>

                        In addition to the downloadable catalog file, this website provides an interactive database to enable simple searches and 
                        inspections of individual spectra and the production of specialized catalogs of different classes of lines. The DR7 catalog 
                        currently available in this database contains 84,000 high quality systems (21,300 of which have 3 identified lines 
                        at the same redshift, to within 250 km/s or dz < 0.0006 at z = 2) and a larger number that are consistent, 
                        but based on only two lines (mainly, C IV doublets near rest frame λ=1550 A). Unverified, 
                        low confidence identifications are also cataloged for future followup. <br> <br>

                        Note: The SDSS-III/IV BOSS/eBOSS survey has produced an even larger sample of QSOs, and a catalog of absorbers in that sample, 
                        in a similar format to the current catalog, is being prepared. The ultimate DR16 data set will include ~150,000 systems in total, 
                        with redshifts ranging from z = 0.03 to z = 5, identified objectively and without prejudice for abundances, redshift range, 
                        or ionization type. <br> <br>

                        Questions about this dataset can be sent to Britt Lundgren (blundgre@unca.edu).
